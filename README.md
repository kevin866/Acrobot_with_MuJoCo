  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

* **Using conda:**

  ```bash
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  ```

### File Overview

* **`wind.py`**
  Simulates real-time wind effects.
  *(Run with: `mjpython wind.py`)*

* **`wind_re.py`**
  Records the wind simulation for later playback or analysis.
  *(Run with: `mjpython wind_re.py`)*

* **`acrobot_env.py`**
  Custom environment wrapper. You can modify the reward function and other environment settings here (e.g., energy cost).

* **`agent.py`**
  Sample script to train a model using the environment.
  *(Run with: `python agent.py`)*

* **`eva.py`**
  Script to visualize and evaluate the best-performing policy.
  *(Run with: `mjpython eva.py`)*

* **`train.py`**
  Trains the PPO model on the windy acrobot.
  *(Run with: `python train.py`)*
  After training, use the following command to visualize training results:

  ```bash
  tensorboard --logdir=./ppo_acrobot_tensorboard/
  ```

  The graph to watch is **explained variance** â€” the closer to 1, the better the model (theoretically).

* **`eval.py`**
  Evaluates the trained model.

* **`vis.py`**
  Visualizes the trained model.
